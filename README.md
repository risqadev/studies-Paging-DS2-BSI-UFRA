# Paging Data structures using Javascript

Implementations of some page replacement algorithms using Javascript, including:

- FIFO (First In, First Out);
- LRU (Least Recently Used);
- LFU (Least Frequently Used).

Set parameters in ```inputs.js``` and run the correspondent file with Node.js. Example:

```
node fifo.js
```
